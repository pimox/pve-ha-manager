This starts out with a "active scenario", i.e., a non-empty/default manager and
HW status.

We test what happens if a service needs to get recovered but
select_service_node cannot return any possible node, while it's original node
it was on is already online again (after fencing).

Ensures that the node does not starts the service before the HA manager
transitions it away from the "recovery" state
