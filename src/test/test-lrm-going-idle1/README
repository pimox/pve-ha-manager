Test an user triggered service removal from a previously active LRM, which
should make said LRM going idle and dropping the lock once enough cycles passed
without any new service.

We use some delays to stall execution, as else we'd exit the test-simulation
earlier than the 60 rounds idle time required before the LRM gives up their
lock and watchdog.
