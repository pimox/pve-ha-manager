Test what happens if a service needs to get recovered but select_service_node
cannot return any possible node, and then the user triggers some CRM comand
like `migration`, `stop` and finally a `disable`

Expected Result:
Try recovery continuosly, ignore the migrate and stop command, we cannot honor
them for a in `recovery` service. Only the `disabled` one can get us out here,
besides, naturally, if a recovery node would be found or the service would get
deleted from the HA resource configuration completely.
